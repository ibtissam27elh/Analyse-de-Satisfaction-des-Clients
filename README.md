# Customer Satisfaction Analysis (NLP) : 

Predicting Customer Sentiment with Machine Learning is a project designed to analyze and predict customer sentiment based on textual data.

### Libraries and Models Used

During the development of this project, a variety of libraries and machine learning models were employed to enhance its functionality and performance. Some of the key tools and models utilized include:

#### Libraries:

1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):**
   - NLTK was used for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.

2. **Scikit-learn:**
   - Scikit-learn played a crucial role in implementing machine learning algorithms, preprocessing data, and evaluating model performance.

3. **Gensim:**
   - Gensim was utilized for implementing Word2Vec, a powerful word embedding model, to capture semantic relationships in the textual data.

#### Word Embedding Model:

  **Word2Vec:**
   - Word2Vec was employed to create word embeddings, facilitating the understanding of contextual relationships between words in the text.

#### Machine Learning Models:

**ANN:**
   - ANN An ensemble learning approach, such as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), was implemented to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model."

These libraries and models collectively contributed to the success of the project, providing a robust foundation for sentiment analysis and customer satisfaction prediction.
